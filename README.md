# Description

An information site about SpaceX. Utilizes two different APIs in order to display live weather data and the most current news regarding SpaceX. Provides additional information such as the history, goals, and accomplishments of the company. (Takes about 30 seconds to boot up. This is due to the hosting service being in rest mode. It has nothing to do with my own code.)

# Features

- Displays data on the weather around SpaceX's Launch sites.
- Uses YouTube Data API to show the latest news at SpaceX.
- Has a rundown of SpaceX's history and goals.
