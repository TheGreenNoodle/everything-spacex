      "Reusing rockets has been a big part of SpaceX's success. Current generation rockets are only partially reusable and require a long refurbishment process before they can launch again. While this has significantly reduced space travel costs, there are better options in the works at SpaceX. Starship is a fully reusable rocket that is in development at SpaceX. Estimated launch costs are around 2 million USD and it could possibly have a turnaround time of an hour or less.",

      "Imagine being able to travel halfway across the world in under an hour. This may soon be possible with the help of Starship. The idea is that Starship will be able to hold 1000 people. These people would be taken to a sea launch port. Then the rocket will fly up to low Earth orbit. The starship will then reenter the Earth's atmosphere. It will then whip its tail end around and land on another seaport. Ticket prices are expected to be around first-class plane tickets.",

    text:
      "Once Starship is proven to be safe and reliable, SpaceX plans on sending people back to the Moon and for the first time ever to Mars. The rocket is designed to hold 100 people for the 9-month journey. It can act as a temporary housing space on the Moon and Mars while crews work on more permanent housing. It can also be refilled on Mars since it is fueled by methane.",
